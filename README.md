# Tests Generator
This python modules allow automatic generation of unit test code for **Django** python framework.
In order to autogenerate the code you need to add a **test_urls.json** into the app folder you want the code to be
autogenerated.

The file should follow this pattern:

    {
        "urls": [
            {
                "name": "name_of_the_test",
                "url": "url in which generate the test"
            },
            ...
        ]
    }
